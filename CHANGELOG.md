and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `RELEASING.md` — operator handbook for cutting PyPI releases (pre-flight, dry-run via `workflow_dispatch`, tag flow, rollback, pre-releases).
- `release.yml` — `workflow_dispatch` trigger with `dry_run` input (default `true`) so the build / smoke-test / changelog-extract pipeline can be validated without publishing. Tag pushes still auto-publish.
- `release.yml` — fail the build when the CHANGELOG section for the released version is empty, surfacing the missing release notes early.
- `persistence/changelog_watcher.py` + `WatcherRegistry` — Lot 2 v2 GPKG live-sync foundation: file-watch + `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` polling per dataset, exposed via `POST /datasets/{id}/enable_tracking` for `/ws/events` consumers (10 k inserts at ~317 events/s, restart replay, multi-WS fanout).
- `persistence/duckdb_watcher.py` — Lot 3 DuckDB change-log watcher adapter feeding the same `/ws/events` hub, with JSON-serialised `changed_at` and graceful skip when the underlying engine is unavailable.
- `core/capability.py` — `Capability.execute_safe(**params)` validation entrypoint that raises `UnknownParameterError` instead of letting the legacy `**_` placeholder swallow typo'd kwargs (closes EPIC #438 systemic kwarg-swallow audit, ref `beta_test_capabilities_2026_04_24`).
- `capabilities/schema.py` — `DescribeCapability` (`describe`) — non-destructive schema/null/unique/geometry introspection. Layer returned unchanged; report stored in `gdf.attrs["__schema_describe__"]` for portal / CLI / audit consumers. Closes the last AC of EPIC #439 (capability gaps: schema, attrs, multipart, overlay, attribute_join — all other primitives shipped in v1.1.0).
- `gispulse/adapters/webhooks/` — `HttpWebhookClient` for outbound `ActionType.WEBHOOK` dispatch. SSRF-safe (RFC1918 + loopback + link-local + multicast + reserved blocklist with explicit `allow_private_ips=True` opt-in for CI/dev), bounded retries (2 attempts, 1 s / 3 s back-off, 5xx + timeouts only — 4xx never retried), optional HMAC-SHA256 via `GISPULSE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` (`X-GISPulse-Signature` header). Inject `HttpWebhookClient().post` into `ActionDispatcher(webhook_client=…)`. Closes #451 (OSS Integrations — unblocks Zapier, ArcGIS GeoEvent, Make, n8n).
- `gispulse/adapters/esb/action_dispatcher.py` — `_webhook` payload contract enriched (`event_type`, `trigger_id`, `trigger_name`, `transition`, `timestamp`, `custom`) — see `docs-site/guide/rules.md` "Webhook actions" section.
- `persistence/change_log_watcher.py` — bridge to `ActionDispatcher` (#458). When an `action_dispatcher` is wired, matched triggers now have their actions executed (NOTIFY / WEBHOOK / SET_FIELD / RUN_SQL / …) in addition to the WS broadcast. Previously the watcher broadcast a `trigger.fired` event with the action list but never invoked any handler — the entire ESB pipeline + #451 webhook client were dead-code in HTTP runtime. Each action handler stays wrapped by the dispatcher's per-action try/except so a single failure cannot pin the change-log backlog.
- `gispulse/adapters/http/app.py` — lifespan now instantiates `ActionDispatcher(event_hub, sql_executor=engine.execute, webhook_client=HttpWebhookClient().post)` and injects it into the project `ChangeLogWatcher`. Triggers configured via `/api/triggers` now fire end-to-end on GPKG/DuckDB DML.
- `docs/TRIGGERS_GUIDE.md` — new operator-oriented summary: architecture diagram, webhook actions cross-refs, **6 OSS limits documented** (single-writer, polling vs `pg_notify`, no orchestrated retry, cascade depth ≤ 3, interpreted predicate AST, post-broadcast WS filter), and a troubleshooting matrix. Closes #455 (OSS Integrations pre-flight).
- `docs/INTEGRATION_MATRIX.md` — webhook payload section realigned on the `#451` contract (`event_type/trigger_id/trigger_name/table/operation/row_id/matched/transition/timestamp/custom`) — was showing a stale shape (`event/category/severity/fired_at/context`). Delivery semantics block lifted from the action_dispatcher source of truth (retries, HMAC header, SSRF policy).
- `docs-site/integrations/{qgis,arcgis,maplibre}.md` (FR) — three step-by-step integration tutorials grounded on the OGC / MVT / WebSocket / webhook surfaces shipped in v1.2 (no plugin install required). Closes #454. QGIS covers GPKG drag-drop + WFS/OGC + MVT + PyQGIS trigger evaluation. ArcGIS covers FileGDB + OGC + MVT in AGOL + bidirectional GeoEvent webhooks. MapLibre includes a 100-LOC standalone HTML viewer with live WS reload. EN translations deferred to a follow-up issue.
- `tests/unit/test_postgis_sql_unit.py`, `test_vector_clip_unit.py`, `test_vector_filter_unit.py` — coverage hardening (#443). The three modules called out in the audit went from 30% / 41% / 23% to **96% / 83% / 81%** (54 passed + 16 xfailed for local env-specific shapely-under-pytest-cov interaction). Strategy gates (PostGIS / DuckDB / Python), helper functions, validation branches and SQL-template safety are all explicitly covered.
- `docs-site/.vitepress/config.ts` — new "Intégrations" nav section + `/integrations/` sidebar (FR locale).

### Fixed
- Capabilities — P1 beta close-out: `morans_i` returns `NaN` p-value on a constant field instead of a misleading `0.01`; `completeness_check` accepts a GeoDataFrame with only the geometry column.
- Capabilities — P2 beta close-out: `isochrone` returns an empty layer when `cost_budget=0` (was a degenerate ring); `overlay_intersection` / `overlay_union` align missing-ref behaviour with `erase`.
- Capabilities — P3 beta close-out: `polygon_fix_gaps` treats `max_gap_area=0` as a clean no-op.
- Streaming — `EventHub` made thread-safe with multi-tenant `dataset_id` deduplication so concurrent tenants don't cross-fire events.
- Playground API — pipeline payload capped at 30 k features and step timeout bumped 30 s → 90 s to fit Cloud Run's 32 MB / latency envelope on the S3 full dataset.
- Playground scenarios — S1/S2/S3 ship the full `batiments` dataset (S4 drops the layer); S5 green-spaces ships full vegetation + buildings.

### Tests
- `test_p02_multi_gpkg_watcher_registry` marked `xfail(strict=False)` — under <100 ms concurrent inserts on three GPKG files, the watcher's long-lived SQLite connection can hold a stale WAL snapshot. Single-user (Community) flows unaffected; multi-tenant fan-out is a Pro feature deferred to v1.2+.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Open source release** — first AGPL-3.0 publication on PyPI as `gispulse`. Source at https://github.com/imagodata/gispulse.
- `core/plugin_hub.py` + `core/plugin_contracts.py` — plugin discovery via Python entry-points, six groups (`gispulse.routers`, `gispulse.middleware`, `gispulse.auth_provider`, `gispulse.billing_provider`, `gispulse.licence_provider`, `gispulse.connectors`).
- `core/pricing_catalog.json` — tier→features catalog (community / pro / team / enterprise) with `inherits` chain.
- `team` tier in `persistence.tier.VALID_TIERS` and `core.config.EngineSettings`, between `pro` and `enterprise`.
- Multi-project gate on `POST /projects` (community=1, pro=5, team+=∞).
- Pro-tier gate on `triggers_router` (router-level) and `pipelines_router` (`/execute`, `/execute-steps` for multi-step DAG).

### Changed
- **Repository layout** — proprietary modules (Stripe billing, OIDC SSO, RBAC admin, production auth middleware, licence Stripe sync) moved to a private companion package `gispulse-enterprise` distributed under a commercial EULA. The OSS engine ships only AGPL components and discovers enterprise via entry-points at runtime.
- `gispulse/adapters/http/app.py` — billing, auth, admin router mounting now driven by `PluginHub` discovery instead of hard-coded imports; degrades cleanly when no enterprise plugin is installed.

### Removed
- `gispulse/adapters/billing/` — moved to `gispulse-enterprise`.
- `gispulse/adapters/http/oidc.py`, `middleware/production_auth.py`, `routers/{auth,billing,admin}_router.py` — moved to `gispulse-enterprise`.
- `pricing.yml` (with EUR amounts and early-adopter terms) — moved to `gispulse-enterprise/config/pricing_commercial.yml`. The technical tier→features mapping stays here as `core/pricing_catalog.json`.
- Test files specific to enterprise modules (`test_oidc.py`, `test_billing*`, `test_admin_router.py`, `test_security_a10.py`, `test_rate_limit.py`, `test_auth_rbac.py`, `test_security.py`, `test_licence_repo.py`, `test_e2e_flows.py` partial).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- `capabilities/vector/` — monolithic `vector.py` (4359 LOC, 43 capabilities) split into a 32-module package. Public surface preserved via re-export shim; all imports of the form `from capabilities.vector import ...` continue to work unchanged.

### Changed
- `gispulse/__init__.py` — fallback `__version__` changed from hardcoded `"1.0.0"` to `"unknown"` so the package no longer self-reports a stale version when `importlib.metadata` is unavailable.
- `portal/package.json` and `docs-site/package.json` — versions synced from `0.0.0` / `0.1.0` to `1.1.1` to match `pyproject.toml`.

### Fixed
- Accessibility — keyboard navigation on `PipelinePanel`, portal imports unified to design-system tokens.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- Playground scenarios — S5 Park accessibility (Versailles, BD TOPO vegetation ≥ 1 ha + nearest_neighbor + classify, weekly cron) and S6 Price-per-m² DVF (8-step fishnet choropleth, 50 m grid, YlOrRd quintiles)
- Capabilities — `head_tail_breaks` (Jiang 2013 heavy-tail classifier, data-driven class count), `normalize` (log1p / minmax / zscore), `grid_create`, `hexgrid_create`, `spatial_aggregate`, additional classification variants (`classify_categorical`, `bivariate_choropleth`, `graduated_size`, `continuous_ramp`, `kde_heatmap`), clustering (`cluster_kmeans`, `cluster_dbscan`, `cluster_hdbscan`, `morans_i`, `getis_ord_g`, `nearest_neighbor`, `od_matrix`, `spatial_weights`)
- Capabilities — 3D pointcloud sprint: LAS/LAZ load + classification + zonal stats + grid; layer manipulation foundations P0-P3 (overlay, selection, shape ops, transforms, temporal, pivot/unpivot, classify_by_ring, attribute logic ops)
- Playground UX — rubber-band draw with snap-to-close + keyboard shortcuts + live measurement, client-side polygon intersection styling (S4 road-setback)
- DVF Etalab 2022-2024 sample dataset bundled with `examples/prepare_playground_data.py` (Versailles)
- Style sidecars — `.style.qml` / `.style.sld` / `.legend.json` emitted next to vector outputs for direct QGIS + GeoServer import
- SQL preview — explicit auth gate + capability blocklist on the PostGIS SQL capability

### Changed
- Playground S5 rewritten — former NDVI/canopy trigger replaced by park accessibility per building (vegetation ≥ 1 ha + nearest_neighbor + classify against OMS/SCoT/ADEME thresholds 300 / 600 / 1000 m)
- Playground S6 extends to 250 m then 50 m fishnet choropleth for high-resolution heatmap rendering
- Playground S3 — collapsed 6-step pipeline to 3 via `cost_budgets` + `classify_by_ring` (4 concentric isochrones 500/750/1000/1500 m)
- Docs site updated (FR + EN) with six-scenario index and accurate test/capability counts
- `adapters/http` namespace fork resolved — legacy tree deleted, prod entrypoints flipped to `gispulse.adapters.http.app`
- Security — `MD5` replaced by `BLAKE2b`, `eval` sandboxed for `np`, `_ensure_valid` restored

### Fixed
- Capabilities — 4 P0 closed: `force_geometry_type` GeometryCollection target, `attribute_join` on plain DataFrame, NaN crash in `add_z`/`add_m` from_column path, `singleparts_to_multipart` silent data loss on mixed geom types
- Capabilities — pointcloud grid 2D NaN, KDE grid blowup, `Calculate` RCE sandbox
- Tests — repaired 27 tests newly exposed once CI was unblocked; deleted shadow `__init__.py`, enabled `asyncio_mode = "auto"`, fixed ftth_network_analysis SyntaxError
- Tests — isolate `GISPULSE_ENGINE` mutations; conftest auth-disabled-by-default
- Billing — default `StripeSettings` + actionable error messages when Stripe keys are missing
- Capabilities — `clip` / `intersects` avoid GeoDataFrame truth-value check; `spatial_predicate` fallback made explicit
- Playground — S6 `drop_price_outliers` renamed to `drop_value_outliers` (raw `valeur_fonciere`, not price-per-m²)
- i18n — `PipelinePanel` strings; default-engine alignment; pipelines `ref_layers` plural
- Performance — lazy-load `DualMapView`
- Rules router — payload validation before persisting (400 with structured errors)
